# Day 4 Log - OMANI-Therapist-Voice

## Introduction
This log documents the fourth day of development for the OMANI-Therapist-Voice project, focusing on UI integration and pipeline testing. It details the tasks performed, observations made, and plans for finalizing safety features.

## Activities
### UI Integration
- **Date**: Day 4 of development
- **Tasks**:
  - Developed `src/ui/app.py` with Flask to serve `src/ui/templates/index.html` for audio recording and response playback.
  - Integrated `src/utils/monitoring.py` to track pipeline stages and metrics.

### Pipeline Testing
- **Files**: Created `tests/integration/test_pipeline.py` to validate end-to-end flow using `mock_transcript.txt`.
- **Purpose**: Ensured seamless interaction between STT, emotion detection, and TTS.

## Observations
- The UI successfully handled audio input and output, with a latency of 12-15s.
- Pipeline testing revealed a need for safety checks, prompting further development.
- Monitoring data confirmed stable performance, with logs aiding debugging.
