# Day 1 Log - OMANI-Therapist-Voice

## Introduction
This log documents the initial development activities for the OMANI-Therapist-Voice project, a culturally sensitive mental health support system in Omani Arabic. It captures the setup, key tasks, and observations from the first day, providing a foundation for tracking progress and ensuring alignment with project goals.

## Activities
### Project Initialization
- **Date**: Day 1 of development
- **Tasks**:
  - Created the core directory structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `infra/`) to organize code, tests, documentation, and deployment files.
  - Set up `src/utils/voice_capture.py` to handle initial audio input, supporting WebM to WAV conversion.
  - Initialized `tests/unit/test_voice_capture.py` to validate audio capture functionality.

### Documentation Setup
- **Files**: Created initial documentation in `docs/` including `architecture/overview.md` and `reports/benchmarks.md`.
- **Purpose**: Established a framework for architectural design and performance tracking.

## Observations
- The basic framework was successfully established, providing a solid starting point for subsequent development.
- Initial tests confirmed `voice_capture.py` functionality, with plans to expand testing coverage.
- The structure supports modularity, setting the stage for integrating safety and alert systems later.
