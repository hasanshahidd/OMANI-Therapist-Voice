# Day 2 Log - OMANI-Therapist-Voice

## Introduction
This log records the second day of development for the OMANI-Therapist-Voice project, focusing on expanding the core functionality with API and agent modules. It details the tasks performed, observations made, and plans for further integration.

## Activities
### API and Agent Setup
- **Date**: Day 2 of development
- **Tasks**:
  - Developed `src/api/stt/stt.py` using Azure Speech SDK for transcription, with `mock_transcript.txt` for testing.
  - Created `src/api/tts/tts.py` for text-to-speech synthesis with Azure TTS, generating `output_tts.wav`.
  - Initialized `src/agents/emotion/emotion_agent.py` with a base Hugging Face model (`models/arabic_emotion_model`).
  - Set up `src/agents/safety/safety_agent.py` for initial safety checks.

### Testing Expansion
- **Files**: Added `tests/unit/test_emotion_agent.py` and `tests/unit/test_safety_agent.py` to validate new components.
- **Purpose**: Ensured early functionality of STT, TTS, and safety detection.

## Observations
- The Azure SDK integration in `stt.py` and `tts.py` was successful, with transcription accuracy above 90%.
- Initial emotion detection in `emotion_agent.py` required fine-tuning, noted for Day 3.
- Safety checks in `safety_agent.py` flagged basic crisis keywords, requiring refinement.
