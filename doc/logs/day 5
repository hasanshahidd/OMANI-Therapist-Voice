# Day 5 Log - OMANI-Therapist-Voice

## Introduction
This log records the fifth and final day of development for the OMANI-Therapist-Voice project, focusing on implementing the safety alert system and custom tokenization. It details the tasks, observations, and completion of the initial development phase.

## Activities
### Safety Alert System
- **Date**: Day 5 of development
- **Tasks**:
  - Enhanced `src/agents/safety/safety_agent.py` to detect crisis content and halt the pipeline.
  - Updated `src/ui/app.py` and `src/ui/templates/index.html` to display safety alerts with referral and emergency contacts.
  - Disabled TTS in `src/api/tts/tts.py` for safety cases.

### Tokenization Integration
- **Files**: Developed `src/utils/tokenization.py` for custom text segmentation, integrated into `src/agents/emotion/emotion_agent.py`.
- **Purpose**: Improved model input quality and consistency.

## Observations
- The safety alert system successfully halted the pipeline for crisis cases, displaying alerts as intended.
- Tokenization enhanced emotion detection accuracy, with logs confirming proper integration.
- The project met the <20s latency target, averaging 12-15s per `monitoring.py`.
