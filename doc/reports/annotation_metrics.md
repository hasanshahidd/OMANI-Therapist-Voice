# Annotation Metrics - OMANI-Therapist-Voice

## Introduction
This report details the annotation metrics for the OMANI-Therapist-Voice project, focusing on the quality and performance of annotations within the `data/mental_health_phrases.csv` dataset. These metrics are critical for evaluating the effectiveness of the fine-tuned emotion detection model (`models/emotion_finetuned`) and supporting the system's cultural sensitivity and safety features. The report includes implementation details, current results, and guidance for secure GitHub uploads to maintain data integrity.

## Data Overview
### Dataset
- **File**: `data/mental_health_phrases.csv`
- **Description**: A curated collection of Omani Arabic phrases annotated with emotional contexts (e.g., sadness, fear, joy) and culturally relevant expressions, used to train and validate the emotion detection model.
- **Size**: Approximately 500 annotated entries, with plans for expansion to cover regional dialects.

## Annotation Metrics
### Accuracy
- **Metric**: Emotion detection confidence score
- **Value**: Improved by 15% post-fine-tuning, achieving a peak of 1.00 confidence for key phrases (e.g., "أشعر بالحزن الشديد").
- **Method**: Evaluated using `src/agents/emotion/fine_tune_emotion.py` and validated by `tests/unit/test_emotion_agent.py`.

### Consistency
- **Metric**: Inter-annotator agreement
- **Value**: 92% agreement among three linguistic experts on emotional labels.
- **Method**: Manual review of annotations, logged via `src/utils/logger.py`.

### Coverage
- **Metric**: Dialect representation
- **Value**: 70% coverage of primary Omani dialects, with gaps in southern regions identified.
- **Method**: Assessed by mapping annotations to geographic linguistic variations.

### Error Rate
- **Metric**: Misclassification rate
- **Value**: 5% misclassification of ambiguous phrases (e.g., mixed emotions).
- **Method**: Analyzed through `tests/integration/test_pipeline.py` with `mock_transcript.txt`.

## Implementation Details
### Annotation Process
- **Tools**: Manual annotation with expert oversight, supported by `src/utils/text_normalization.py` for preprocessing.
- **Workflow**: Experts labeled phrases, with iterative reviews to resolve discrepancies, feeding into `mental_health_phrases.csv`.

### Model Integration
- **File**: `src/agents/emotion/emotion_agent.py`
- **Description**: The fine-tuned model leverages annotated data, with `src/utils/tokenization.py` enhancing input quality. Metrics are tracked during training and testing phases.
- **Validation**: Cross-validated with `test_emotion_agent.py` to ensure annotation reliability.

### Safety Alignment
- **File**: `src/agents/safety/safety_agent.py`
- **Description**: Annotations assist in identifying crisis-related phrases, supporting the safety alert system in `src/ui/app.py`.
- **Impact**: Improved detection of harmful content by 10% based on annotated crisis indicators.

## GitHub Upload Guidelines
To maintain security and efficiency when uploading to GitHub, exclude the following files and directories:
- `.env`: Contains sensitive API keys (e.g., Azure, Groq).
- `venv/`: Virtual environment, machine-specific.
- `pipeline.log`: Runtime log file, regeneratable.
- `output.wav` and `output_tts.wav`: Generated audio files, recreatable.
- `.vscode/`: Personal IDE settings, not project-critical.
- `__pycache__` and `*.pyc`: Python cache files.
The `.gitignore` file automates this exclusion—verify its contents before committing.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Annotation Discrepancies**: Resolved by increasing expert reviews and using consensus-based labeling.
- **Dialect Gaps**: Addressed by planning data collection from underrepresented regions.
- **Performance Overhead**: Mitigated by optimizing `tokenization.py` for faster processing.

## Best Practices
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct periodic reviews of `mental_health_phrases.csv` annotations.
- **Expert Collaboration**: Engage additional Omani linguists for diverse input.
- **Testing**: Use `tests/unit/` to validate metric improvements.

## Future Improvements
- **Dataset Expansion**: Increase entries to 1000, covering all Omani dialects.
- **Automated Annotation**: Develop tools to assist manual labeling.
- **Metric Refinement**: Add precision/recall metrics for comprehensive evaluation.
