# Arabic Data Quality Framework

## Overview
Defines processes for ensuring high-quality Arabic datasets for the Omani-Therapist-Voice project.

## Planned Processes
- **Normalization**: Standardize Omani Arabic text, including diacritics and punctuation.
- **Dialect Mapping**: Map Omani dialect variations to standard Arabic for consistency.
- **Annotation Quality**: Target >90% inter-annotator agreement and >95% cultural/contextual accuracy.
- **Validation**: Check dataset integrity at each phase (data prep, training, evaluation).

## Next Steps
- Implement text normalization in `src/utils/text_normalization.py` (Day 2).
- Define annotation metrics in `docs/reports/annotation_metrics.md` (Day 3).
